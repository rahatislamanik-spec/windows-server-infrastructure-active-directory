# Windows Server Infrastructure & Active Directory Administration

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and administration of a Windows Server enterprise environment with a focus on centralized identity management, access control, and core infrastructure services.  
The lab simulates real-world system administration scenarios commonly found in corporate IT environments.

The environment was built to reflect enterprise best practices, including centralized authentication, policy enforcement, secure name resolution, and automated IP address management.

## 🎯 Project Objectives & Outcomes

- Designed a single-domain Active Directory forest for centralized identity and access management  
- Implemented Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) to manage users, groups, and organizational units  
- Applied Group Policy Objects (GPOs) to enforce security baselines and configuration standards  
- Configured DNS to support domain name resolution and service location  
- Implemented DHCP for automated and consistent IP address assignment  
- Joined and validated client systems within the domain environment  
- Applied role-based administration and troubleshooting aligned with enterprise practices
